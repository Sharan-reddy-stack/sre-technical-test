## Service Monitoring Behaviors

### Rails Application Monitoring
The Rails application implements comprehensive self-monitoring capabilities:

- **Health Endpoint Monitoring**: The `/health` endpoint provides real-time service status and dependency health checks, returning detailed JSON responses including database and Redis connectivity status
- **Metrics Endpoint**: The `/metrics` endpoint exposes Prometheus-format metrics updated every 5 seconds, providing detailed application performance data
- **Key Behaviors Monitored**:
  - Application availability through continuous health checks and the `rails_up` metric
  - Response time tracking for immediate performance degradation detection
  - Memory usage monitoring for resource leak identification and capacity planning
  - Request volume tracking across all endpoints for traffic pattern analysis
  - Thread count monitoring for concurrency management
  - Database connection pool utilization for resource optimization

### PostgreSQL Database Monitoring
Comprehensive database layer monitoring ensures data layer reliability:

- **Connection Health Testing**: Continuous database connectivity validation through automated connection attempts every 10 seconds
- **Performance Metrics Collection**: Query execution time tracking, connection pool status, and database-specific performance indicators
- **Key Behaviors Monitored**:
  - Database availability through the `database_up` metric for immediate failure detection
  - Connection pool status via `rails_active_connections` to prevent connection exhaustion
  - Query performance tracking for database optimization opportunities
  - Transaction volume and latency for capacity planning

### Redis Cache Monitoring
Cache layer monitoring ensures optimal application performance:

- **Connectivity Testing**: Redis server availability through ping operations every 10 seconds
- **Performance Tracking**: Cache response times and connectivity stability monitoring
- **Key Behaviors Monitored**:
  - Cache server availability through the `redis_up` metric
  - Performance impact measurement when cache becomes unavailable
  - Connection stability for identifying network or cache server issues

## Alerting Rules Explanation

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Action Required)

#### ApplicationDown Alert
- **Trigger**: `rails_up == 0` for more than 1 minute
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Reasoning**: Core service unavailability directly impacts all users and violates availability SLOs
- **Expected Action**: Immediate investigation, service restart procedures, and incident response activation
- **Business Impact**: Complete service outage affecting all customer interactions

#### DatabaseDown Alert
- **Trigger**: `database_up == 0` for more than 1 minute
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Reasoning**: Database failures cause immediate and complete service degradation since the application cannot function without data access
- **Expected Action**: Database team escalation, connection troubleshooting, and database server health verification
- **Business Impact**: Data operations halt, potentially causing data consistency issues

### Warning Alerts (Investigation Required)

#### RedisDown Alert
- **Trigger**: `redis_up == 0` for more than 2 minutes
- **Severity**: Warning
- **Reasoning**: Cache layer failures degrade application performance but allow continued operation in degraded mode
- **Threshold Justification**: 2-minute threshold allows for brief network interruptions and Redis restart operations
- **Expected Action**: Cache server investigation, performance impact assessment, and Redis cluster health verification

#### HighMemoryUsage Alert (Future Enhancement)
- **Trigger**: `rails_memory_usage_bytes > 200MB` for more than 5 minutes
- **Severity**: Warning  
- **Reasoning**: Sustained high memory usage indicates potential memory leaks that could lead to application crashes
- **Threshold Justification**: 200MB threshold based on typical Rails application memory footprint in development environments
- **Expected Action**: Memory usage pattern analysis, potential memory leak investigation, and application restart consideration
